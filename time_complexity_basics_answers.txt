1. A function that estimates the time a program will take to execute.

2. The physical time it takes for an algorithm or program to run.

3. You add up the runtimes of all of the statements within a program, then simplify the term to the largest expression, and drop any constants. 

4. 

O(1), O(log n), O(n),  O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)

O(1), O(log n), O(n),  O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), O(n!)

5. O(n) and my example will be picking up playing cards off the floor. The amount of time it takes, is connected to how many cards I need to pick up!!!

6. O(n)

7. O(n^2)

8. O(2^n)

9. Number 6 has the most effecient code snippet.
